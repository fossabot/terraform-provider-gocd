Terraform provider for GoCD Server

## Installation

    $ brew tap drewsonne/tap
    $ brew install terraform-provider-gocd
    $ tf-install-provider gocd

__NOTE__: `terraform` does not currently provide a way to easily install 3rd party providers. Until this is implemented,
the `tf-install-provider` utility can be used to copy the provider binary to the correct location.

## Demo

You will need docker and terraform >= 0.10.0 installed for this demo to work.

Either build the provider with `go build` or download it from the gihub repository. If you download it, make sure the binary is in the current folder.

	$ go build

Spin up the test gocd server, with endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:8153/go/

    $ make provision-test-gocd && sh ./scripts/wait-for-test-server.sh

Then initialise and apply the configuration.

    $ terraform init
    $ terraform apply

When you're finished, run:

    $ make teardown-test-gocd
